You can choose the type of the task, add notes as well as your estimate of the number of pomos you are going to spend on the task.

Once the timer started, you can see there is a progress bar below the timer that indicates the number of pomos you have finished and you goal. And below the progress bar displays some random inspirational quotes from our app’s library. The timer also has a filling effect that shows the progress of the current pomo. You can stop the music anytime. You can also abort the current cycle and go back to the main page.

The default period of a pomo is 25 minutes. After each 25 minute pomoyou finish, you will get a 5 minute short break. And after every 4 pomos, you will get a 15-minute long break.
