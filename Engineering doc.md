In the repository, we have 2 branches “main” and “feat”. “feat” contains newly pushed work over old contents, and “main” contains the approved merged work after intensive testing. In either branch, the directory admin contains meeting notes, group rules, and videos; source contains all our source code; specs contains decisions, pipelines, and flowcharts we made. To make a new change in our repo, you need to first take up an issue. Then someone can make a pull request to merge the new solution into the “feat” branch and close the issue. After code style reviewing and functionality testing, the change will be merged into “main” branch.
