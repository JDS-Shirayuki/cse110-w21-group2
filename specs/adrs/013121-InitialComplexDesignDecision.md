# Initial Complex Design Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

This is the first decision of our project.
What design philosophy of the user interface and features should we insist to start a good beginning?

## Considered Options

* [Simple Design] - We provide basic artistic designs in the web elements and build only the basic features of the pomo timer.
* [Complex Design] - Use intensive artistic design elements and provide the user with comperhensive features beyond a simple timer (user history, usage analyze...).
* [Skeleton Design] - Do not employ any artistic designs at all, build only the basic features of the pomo timer.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Complex Design", because

* It's easier to reduce elements than adding elements in later satges of development. Since we're not busy at this time, we can prepare more elements and decide which ones to use later.
* User experence is highly related to the rationality and artistic values of the user interface. Choosing the Complex Design option will help us more to build a beautiful user interface.
* New features will also make a unique user experience other than the experience on sofware of similar roles.
* Team project may be graded on feature/layout complexity. More complex designs prove us can master the art of software engineering.
