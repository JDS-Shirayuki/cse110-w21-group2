# Pomodoro Timer --- 2.0

## Context and Problem Statement

We are in the second phase of development of our pomodoro timer and we realized that our current version is way too complicated for the users.  
The user interface of last version with lots of features is fancy and distractive to our users with and we decide to create a neater main interface with only main features.  


## Considered Options

* Pomodoro Timer 2.0
* Keep all the features/Infos/Aethetics designed at first while moving less important ones to corners and edges of the website, making it less distractive.
* Keep the two main ways of starting timers(quick start and customized start) and make them as our top priorities.
* Separate and clean interface for quick start and customized start

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Pomodoro Timer 2.0", because

* The core of Pomodoro timer is to increase the efficiency of the users and thus a less distractive UI will make our project more suitable for users.
* Some of the main features are not yet finished and we want to see how well they run on our webisite before deleting them.
* This version avoids that our project being too simple by keeping those features, we want to be successful and ambitious at the same time.
* Separating the interface of two kinds of timers makes it easier for the users to master the functions.
* Keeping two main timers gives users more options, they can be either super focus with quick start or creative with customized start.
